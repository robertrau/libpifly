GPS CSV format - Detection of columns containing coordinates is based on attribute name - please rename columns containing coordinates to any of these:
x, xcoord, xcoordinate, coordx, coordinatex, longitude, long (and of course: y, ycoord, ycoordinate, coordy, coordinatey, latitude, lat). If you have geometry as WKT or WKB, use wkt or wkt name for the geometry column name.

For wkt information, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry



Preferred File Types for Google Maps Content Partners (GMCP)

.SHP (Shapefile): Submit required file extensions (at least the .shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj) in a .zip file (zipped file)

.CSV (Comma Separated Value): Submit data separated by commas, with each column surrounded by quotes.  Header row and spatial attributes (latitude & longitude coordinates) are required.

.KML/.KMZ (Keyhole Markup Language): Represent the data as SchemaData and SimpleFields (preferred) or ExtendedData. .kml/.kmz files must have address fields. KML/KMZ files can be created with Google Earth - To view more information on this, click this link https://www.youtube.com/user/googleearthweb
